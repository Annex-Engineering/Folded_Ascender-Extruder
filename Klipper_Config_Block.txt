These are good starting settings for the extruder, I have copy pasted my entire block out of my klipper config below:

# Ascender config block
[extruder]
rotation_distance: 22.39 #for 5mm Shaft Driven Bondtech gearsets
gear_ratio: 20:1
microsteps: 4
full_steps_per_rotation: 200 #1.8deg Motor

pressure_advance: 0.007 # Configure based on klipper docs. This is a good starting point at default smoothing time
max_extrude_only_distance: 1400.0
max_extrude_only_velocity: 75.0
max_extrude_only_accel: 1500

#settings for NEMA14 Stepper

interpolate: True
run_current: 0.30 # up to 0.35A
stealthchop_threshold: 0
