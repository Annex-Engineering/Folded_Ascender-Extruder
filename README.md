# Double Folded Ascender Extruder - Release "4"

Folded Ascender is a take on the "popular" worm direct-driven extruder system. It is available in a 20:1 variant.

The original concept was originally developed by Trails and RentableSocks back in ~March 2019, it has since evolved many times and RentableSocks has now taken over development on this extruder full time.
